		<h2 class="section"> Questions and Answers</h2>
			<div class="text"> 
				<p class="Question">Who are you?</p>
				<p>Answer: <br/>I was raised on a Pick Your Own farm just north of Minneapolis MN where we spent our summers weeding, picking, selling and weeding (again) 60 acres of Fruits and Vegetables.  As an adult I am still appalled at the price people will pay for 1/2 pint of raspberries, its just crazy.   Today I live just south of where I grew up with a mini garden on a city lot, just enough room to let me use my Horticulture degree without too much weeding</p>
				<p class="Question">What do you do?</p>
				<p>Answer: <br/>I am an IT Professional with a background in retail support, Point of Sale software development and now work as a tech lead that focus on web and mobile applications projects for our companies wholesale customers.</p>
				<p class="Question">Why are you taking this course?</p>
				<p>Answer: <br/>My background has been primarily in Point of Sale which some days seems worlds away from web and mobile applications.  My move to web/mobile was not really a conscious thought just where I ended up as our company went through several rounds of restructuring, but I find it fascinating and hoping this course will help me better understand how we integrate with all the back end systems.</p>
				<p class="Question">What previous experience do you have with programming?</p>
				<p>Answer: <br/>No web development experience, primarily my work has been on the proprietary credit/debit systems with some .NET VB windows console applications as needed (we won't bring up batch as it may be best to forget those years!).</p>
				<<p class="Question">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</p>
				<p>Answer: <br/>PC</p>
